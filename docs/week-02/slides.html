  <div> Recap on data modalities</div>

  <div> 
    Data modalities
     <br />    
    Information we can gather from the world and store in digital systems as "data", are mainly from four modalities:
      <br />   
    - Image (picture, video)
      <br />   
    - Text (written language)
      <br />   
    - Audio (music, speech)
      <br />   
    - Tabular(this week's weather in degree celsius, everyone's birthday in this class, sensor data, etc.)
      <br />  
      Can you think of any information that is not from the four categories?
  </div>
  
  
  <div> 
    Data modalities
     <br />    
    - Each data modality has its own characteristics and challenges for representation, processing and analysis.
      <br />
     - We structure our unit syllabus based on the different data modalities, each week focusing on one modality (with a few exceptions).
      <br />

    <div> Recap on neural networks</div>



    
  <div> How to numberify the size of digital images?
     <br />  
    - Two numbers for its width and height (how many pixels).
    <br />  
    e.g. 3840 x 2160 for 4K resolution        
    <br />      
    - Sometimes another number for how many color channels there are.
   <br />      
    e.g. 256 x 256 x 3 for an RGB color image
  </div>

  <div>Here is one way to numberify digital images:
     <br />  
  - Three numbers for each pixel representing the RGB values in color images
     <br />     
  - One number for each pixel representing the greyscale value in grey images </div>
  </div>
  

  
  <div> How to numberify digital audio? </div>
  
  <div class='layout' style='grid-template-rows:55% 45%;'>

  <div>Here is one way to numberify digital audio:
   <br />  
    - A series of numbers where each number denotes a displacement value from silence at that point of time </div>
  </div>
  
  <div> Here is one way to numberify text:
  <br />  
  - Think about when you are looking up a word in a dictionaryüìï using page number and index
  <br /> 
  - To decode the pair of (page number, index) back to actual words, you will need to pass that dictionary around.
  <br /> 
  - OR?         
  <br />           
  - more on this in week11
  </div>
  
  
  <div> A tricky question for you!
   <br /> 
  How to numberify the label of an image being a dogüê∂ image or a catüòº image?
  <br /> 
  You are free to define any dictionary/protocol to explain the number(s) you have used.
  </div>
  
  <div> One possible way:
   <br /> 
  - I will use two numbers and each number is either 0 or 1.
   <br /> 
  - I will have the first number indicating if there is a dog in the image.
   <br />
  - And I will have the second number indicating if there is a cat in the image.
   <br />
  - If it is a dog-only image: [1, 0] (square brackets here are optional)
   <br />
  - If it is a cat-only image: [0, 1]
   <br />
  - If it is a dog and cat image: [1, 1]
   <br />
  - What does this numeric representation [0, 0] mean in this context?           
  </div>
  
  <div> any questions so far? </div>
  
  <div> Image classification </div>
  
  <div> What we will talk about today:
   <br />  
  - What is image classification? 
   <br />  
  - What can an image classification model do?
   <br />   
  What we will NOT talk about today:
   <br />   
  - How to make an image classification model from scratch?
   <br />   
  - How to modify an image classification model?         
  </div>
  
  <div> Image classification
   <br />  
  - It is a machine learning and computer vision task. 
   <br />  
  - It is a stepping stone task in computer vision and computational pattern recognition. 
   <br />  
  - The goal is to train a model to recognize and assign a predefined label or class to an input image. 
  </div>
  
  
   <div> Your first AI model to inspect!!! </div>
  
   <div> One hack for inspecting any model: 
    <br /> 
    Because a model is about "input -> process -> output",
    <br /> 
    to inspect what a model does, one helpful starting point is to check its input and output!
   </div>
  
  
   <div> Input? Output? </div>
  
  
   <div> Image classification model:
     <br /> 
    - Input: a digital image
    <br /> 
    - output: the predicted classes of the input image 
   </div>
    
   <div> Image classification model:
     <br /> 
   Input (in a bit more details):
    <br /> 
   An image with a pre-defined size.
    <br /> 
   (but you can get around with the size limit simply by resizing and/or cropping images.)
    <br /> 
   (and be careful of the aspect ratio!)
   </div>
  
   <div> Image classification model:
     <br /> 
     Output (in a bit more details):
     <br /> 
     Probabilities assigned to each class from a set of pre-defined classes.
   </div>
  
   <div> 
      Image classification model:
      <br /> 
      It outputs probabilities assigned to each class from a set of pre-defined classes.
      <br /> 
      Let's dive into the "pre-defined classes" bit 
  </div>
  
   <div> Back to the example of dogüê∂-or-catüòº image classification model:
     <br />
       What are the pre-defined classes that this model can predict into?
     <br />
       - a class for "dog" and a class for "cat"
     <br />
       - Can this model tell us which vehicle the input image is?
     <br />
       - üö´
     <br />
       - But it would be interesting to feed a üöó image into the model and see how it improvises.
   </div>
  
   <div> 
      Image classification model:
      <br /> 
      It outputs probabilities assigned to each class from a set of pre-defined classes.
      <br /> 
      Let's dive into the "probabilities" bit 
  </div>
  
  <div> - It is primarily outputing a list of probabilities assigned to each class from the pre-defined class sets 
   <br /> 
    - From there, we can easily post-process the list of probabilities and output human-friendlier result like "which one is the most probable class?"
  </div>
    
  <div> any questions so far? </div>
  
  <div> Takeaway messages from our first encounter with image classification models
   <br />  
  - Each model has a pre-defined input image size.
    <br />  
  - Each model has a pre-defined output classes range.
  </div>
  
  
   <div> A toy example on image classification in playground </div>
  
   <div> Has everyone installed Xcode? </div>
  
   <div> Download the playground <a href="https://moodle.arts.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=1251946">here</a> and double click the file to open it (Xcode should be fired up automatically)</div> 
  
   <div> 
     Don't panic about the chunks of swift code üíô
     <br />
     - The code has been prepared and is ready to run.
     <br />
     - It can predict the given input image's class, one image at a time.
  </div>
  
  <div> 
      All we have to do for this lecture is to:
      <br /> 1. Run the playground as it is.
      <br /> 2. Check the classfication results.
      <br /> 3. Inspect the loaded classification model's input image size and output classes.
      <br /> 4. Swap to another input image and run the playground.

  <div>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqeQByqf_f8">A nice App</a> that makes good use of image classification model </div>

  <div> Today we have talked about:
     <br />
     Representation üß†
       <br /> - descriptive, perspective, and contextual
       <br />
     Numeric representation üå∂Ô∏è
       <br /> - How image, audio and text can be represented by numbers
       <br />
      Image classification üïπÔ∏è
       <br /> - Given an input image, which is of a pre-defined size, a IC model predicts the probabilities of that image assigned to each class from a pre-defined set of classes.
  </div>
  
  
  <div> Homework :)
       <br />
       Hands-on:
       <br /> Select one public dataset of interest and sketch a visualization plan.
      Readings:
       <br /> Read the linked resources, and make notes on thoughts, questions, inspirations and associations.
